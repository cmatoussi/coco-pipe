"""
Base interfaces for descriptor extraction backends.

This module defines the internal contracts shared by built-in descriptor
extractors. The module exposes:

- `BaseDescriptorExtractor` for families that consume validated raw signal
  batches
- `BasePSDDescriptorExtractor` for families that consume shared PSD batches
- `_DescriptorBlock` as the private family output payload
- `make_failure_record` as the shared normalized failure-record helper

The surrounding descriptors stack uses these interfaces to provide:

- explicit runtime dispatch from `DescriptorPipeline`
- deterministic sensor-level descriptor naming
- family-wise metadata and failure collection
- safe merging of family outputs into one stable result dictionary

Notes
-----
`BaseDescriptorExtractor` is an internal extension point for descriptor
families. Unlike dim-reduction reducers, descriptor extractors are stateless at
runtime and do not expose `fit`, persistence, or model objects.

class BaseDescriptorExtractor(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for descriptor extraction families.

    Subclasses receive already validated NumPy inputs and must return one
    `_DescriptorBlock` aligned on the observation axis. The base class keeps
    the extractor API narrow and provides a shared helper for sensor-level
    finalization and deterministic descriptor naming.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : Any
        Typed family configuration parsed by `DescriptorConfig`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    config : Any
        Stored family-specific configuration object.
    family_name : str
        Stable family identifier used in failure records and merged metadata.

    Notes
    -----
    Extractors are stateless at runtime. They do not learn parameters across
    calls; all runtime state is provided explicitly through `extract()`.

    Concrete extractors are expected to:

    1. compute family-specific values with shape ``(n_obs, n_channels)`` for
       each metric
    2. pass those values through :meth:`_finalize_descriptor`
    3. return one `_DescriptorBlock` with aligned names, metadata, and failures

    Examples
    --------
    A minimal concrete extractor typically looks like:

    >>> class MeanOverTimeExtractor(BaseDescriptorExtractor):
    ...     family_name = "toy"
    ...
    ...     def extract(
    ...         self,

    ...         channel_names,
    ...         ids,
    ...         runtime,
    ...     ):
    ...         values = X.mean(axis=-1)
    ...         X_out, names = self._finalize_descriptor(
    ...             values,
    ...             family_prefix="toy",
    ...             metric_name="mean",
    ...             channel_names=channel_names,
    ...         )
    ...         return _DescriptorBlock(
